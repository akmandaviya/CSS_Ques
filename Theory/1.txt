-->> What are CSS Selectors ?
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements we want to style.
  (1) Simple selector==> based on id or class.
  (2) Combination selector==> descendant selector (space) Ex: div (space) p
                          ==> child selector (>) All the elements that are children f specified element Ex: div > page 
                          ==> Adjacent sibling selector (+) An element that is directly adjacent to that element Ex: div + p
                          ==> General sibling selector (-) All elements that are next siblings to that element Ex: div ~ p
  (3) Psuedo-class selectors ==> A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
                                Ex: mouse hover, visited, unvisited links.
  (4) Psuedo-element selectors ==> A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
                                  Ex: Style the first letter, or line, of an element.
                                       Insert content before, or after, the content of an element.
  (5) Attribute Selectors ==> To style HTML elements that have specific attributes or attribute values.
  


  -->> what is CSS position ?
  The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).
  Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. 
  They also work differently depending on the position value.

  -->> Translate in css ?
  The translate() CSS function repositions an element in the horizontal and/or vertical directions. Its result is a <transform-function> data type.

  -->> Calc() in CSS ?
  It is an inbuilt CSS function which allows us to perform calculations. It can be used to calculate length, percentage, time, number, integer frequency, or angle.
  It uses the four simple arithmetic operators add (+), multiply (*), subtract (-), and divide (/).
  It is a powerful CSS concept because it allows us to mix any units, such as percentage and pixel.
  Ex:  width: calc(150% - 75%);   
       height: calc(350px - 75px);
